# SSWS WordPress Plugin Snippets Collection

This is a WordPress plugin that collects useful snippets to enhance hidden/secret WP functionaltyÂ 

## Getting Started

### 1. TODO list of functions and snippets with instructions

- Google Analytics input field into WP dashboard (to be implemented), so the GA code/snippet is unrelated to the theme and not hardcoded into the plugin function.
- Google Maps Key input field into WP dashboard (to be implemented), so the GM code/snippet is unrelated to the theme and not hardcoded into the plugin function.
- Add image placeholder js replacement for missing images; use https://via.placeholder.com/468x60?text=Visit+Blogging.com+Now

C/O https://placeholder.com/  or https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff
- ~~Wrap `Customize Login Screen ver. 3.0` into a function container to add `if(!function_exists(''))` condition~~
- ~~Custom Login Link~~
- ~~Add Alt Description to images, derived from image title or file name~~
- ~~Add Wiki section for Our guidelines: https://seatoskywebsolutions.ca/wiki/spaces/TT/TT-MobileResponsiveGuidelines-240318-0106.pdf~~
- Allow SVG upload in media gallery; the old snippet is not working anymore since WP 5.x
- ~~Update logos in `assets` folder~~
- ~~update linters link into `scripts.env.py`~~
- ~~remove compiled styles for WooCommerce that might conflict with the theme~~
- ~~adjust powered by adim bar text and color to match ssws and not CP~~
- This plugin is optimized for woocommerce child theme injections, so maybe review OOP class structure as per custom CPT plugin
- ...

### 2. Enjoy!
